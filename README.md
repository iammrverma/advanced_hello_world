all are welcomed to make this code better without spoiling it if possible
and yes atleast suggest me a better name for this ðŸ˜…

this program will print the inout string letter by letter but for each letter it start from a and goes till the letter arrives 
but for next letter it will not only start from and goes till the second letter but prints the first letter as a prefix 
for input like "hel" the output will be
a
b
c
.
.
.
h
because we reached 'h' then it goes like 
ha
hb
hc
hd
he
now because we reached 'he' our first two letters then it goes like
hea
heb
hec
.
.
.
hel


hope that help :>
